### What I learned

I've learned to take a figma design and move it to working code. Also getting more use to using React!

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I will be continuing to build my skills in CSS and Javascript.
I will be working on media queries more with future challenges.
